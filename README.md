# Quantum Gaming
## Prepared environment:
1. pip install qiskit[0.24.0]  (New version is not work in some cases)
2. sudo apt-get install python3-tk
3. sudo apt-get install python3-pil python3-pil.imagetk
4. pip install qrandom

## Run the program:
python3 init.py

## Introduction:
The original idea for this quantum game comes from Minesweeper and Catsweeper. Since we considered  probabilistic cases like trap and target, we decided to use quantum instead of classical probability to better apply quantum computing knowledge to this game, and also maintain the playability and entertainment of sweep type game. In our game design, the game panel is 8x8. There are three types of mud blocks, 10 trap mud blocks, 1 target mud block, and the rest are empty mud blocks. To win this game, players should avoid clicking trap mud blocks as much as possible and find out the target mud block. To make this game easier, we add a spell button that can be used to check and link the two unknown blocks at most  three times. And, We set the trap firing rate through the H Gate with a 50 percent probability of 0 and 1, which means that even though the player has hit the trap, there is still a chance of not getting caught. The general idea for the trap in this game is by using  quantum gates. And the qubits are generated by the Quantum Random Number Generator.
